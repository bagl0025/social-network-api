## Usage

There is no front end for this application so you should use Insomnia, Postman, or an API client of your choice to test the routes and functionality.

Using an API client you can view, create, edit, and delete items. A video link (below) shows the full functionality using Insomnia. A snapshot of the Insomnia window (below) shows all of the API routes that will be demonstrated in the video.
